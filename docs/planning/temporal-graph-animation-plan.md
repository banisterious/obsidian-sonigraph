## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding a "Sonic Graph" feature to the Sonigraph plugin using D3-force simulation. The feature provides a static knowledge graph visualization that can be animated over time based on file creation dates, synchronized with musical sonification from the existing audio engine.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Static Graph Visualization**: Show complete knowledge graph with all vault files and connections
- **Temporal Animation**: Optional time-based animation showing graph evolution using file creation dates
- **Audio-Visual Sync**: Synchronize graph animations with musical events from the existing audio engine
- **Multi-Media Support**: Include both notes and attachments (images, PDFs, etc.) as graph nodes
- **Control Center Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Sonigraph interface

### Secondary Objectives
- **Interactive Timeline**: Allow users to scrub through time and control animation playback
- **Performance Optimization**: Smooth 60fps animation even with large graphs (1000+ nodes)
- **Customizable Visualization**: User-configurable visual styles and animation parameters
- **Export Capabilities**: Save timeline animations as video or audio files

## Refined Requirements

Based on design discussions and mockup creation, the following requirements have been established:

### Control Center Integration

#### **New "Sonic Graph" Tab**
- **Tab Placement**: Added to existing Control Center navigation drawer after "Experimental" tab
- **Tab Structure**: Follows existing family-based tab pattern with drawer navigation
- **Compact Preview**: Shows static graph visualization in Control Center tab
- **Launch Button**: "🌐 Open Full Sonic Graph" button to open dedicated modal
- **Play Integration**: "▶️ Play Sonic Graph" button to start temporal animation with audio

#### **Audio Engine Integration**
- **Instrument Respect**: Uses currently enabled instruments from Control Center
- **Real-time Updates**: If user changes instruments while modal is open, audio mapping updates
- **Audio Status**: Shows "Audio: X instruments" status reflecting current enabled instruments
- **Graceful Fallback**: If no instruments enabled, shows appropriate guidance to user

### Modal Design

#### **Two-Modal Strategy**
1. **Control Center Modal**: Existing modal with new Sonic Graph tab
2. **Dedicated Sonic Graph Modal**: Larger modal for full graph exploration

#### **Sonic Graph Modal Features**
- **Modal Header**: 
  - Title: "🌐 Sonic Graph"
  - Control Center button: "🎛️ Control Center" (opens Control Center modal)
  - Settings button: "⚙️ Settings" (future modal configuration)
  - Close button: "×"
- **CSS Sizing**: Uses `:has()` selector for appropriate modal dimensions
- **Static by Default**: Opens with complete static graph showing all files
- **Play-Triggered Animation**: Timeline and animation only activate when user clicks Play

### User Experience Flow

#### **Discovery Path**
1. User opens Control Center for normal Sonigraph usage
2. Notices new "Sonic Graph" tab in navigation drawer
3. Clicks tab to see compact graph preview with vault overview
4. Sees static graph representing all files and connections
5. Can click "Play Sonic Graph" for temporal animation + audio
6. Can click "Open Full Sonic Graph" for detailed exploration

#### **Modal Interaction**
1. **Static Mode** (default):
   - Complete knowledge graph visible
   - All files and connections shown
   - No timeline visible
   - Mode indicator: "📊 Static Mode"
   
2. **Animated Mode** (after clicking Play):
   - Timeline appears and becomes active
   - Temporal animation begins with audio sonification
   - Mode indicator: "🎵 Animated Mode - Playing" 
   - User can pause/stop to return to static mode

#### **Cross-Modal Navigation**
- **From Sonic Graph Modal**: "🎛️ Control Center" button opens Control Center
- **From Control Center**: User can return to Sonic Graph tab or launch full modal
- **Consistent State**: Both modals respect same instrument settings and preferences

#### **Audio Behavior**
- **Static Mode**: No audio (graph is silent)
- **Play Button**: Starts temporal animation with musical sonification
- **Instrument Mapping**: 
  - Notes (markdown) → Piano/Keyboard instruments
  - Images → String instruments  
  - PDFs → Brass instruments
  - Audio files → Woodwind instruments
  - Other files → Electronic/Experimental instruments
- **Note Duration**: Based on content length for markdown files, fixed short durations for attachments
- **Timeline Synchronization**: Music plays as nodes appear chronologically

#### **Naming and Branding**
- **Feature Name**: "Sonic Graph" (not "Timelapse")
- **Clear Distinction**: Differentiated from Obsidian's standard Graph view
- **Sonigraph Context**: Obviously part of the audio plugin ecosystem
- **Temporal Aspect**: Animation and timeline are secondary features, not primary branding

- **Visual indicators** - Node colors/shapes reflect assigned instruments in graph
- **Assignment storage** - Multiple options: frontmatter, plugin settings, or sidecar files
- **Smart defaults** - Fallback hierarchy: custom → file type → default mapping
- **Conflict resolution** - Handle overlapping assignment rules gracefully
- **Import/export** - Share instrument assignment sets between vaults
- **Conditional assignments** - Dynamic rules based on file properties or content
- **Real-time modification** - Change instrument assignments during playback

#### Line-Level Assignment (Advanced)
**Goal**: Granular instrument control within individual documents

##### Content-Based Automatic Assignment
- **Markdown structure mapping**:
  - Headers (`# ## ###`) → Brass instruments (announcements/fanfares)
  - Lists (`- * +`) → Percussion (rhythmic elements)
  - Code blocks (```) → Electronic/synthetic instruments
  - Quotes (`>`) → Strings (contemplative/flowing)
  - Bold/Italic → Accent instruments or volume changes
  - Links → Transition sounds or chord changes
- **Semantic analysis**:
  - Sentiment detection → Major/minor key selection
  - Topic modeling → Technical vs. expressive instrument choices
  - Writing style → Formal (classical) vs. casual (modern) instruments
  - Emotional intensity → Soft vs. powerful instrument selection

##### Manual Assignment Interface
- **In-editor integration**:
  - Line gutters with small instrument icons
  - Right-click context menus for any line
  - Keyboard shortcuts for quick assignment
  - Command palette integration
- **Bulk assignment tools**:
  - Pattern matching with regex support
  - Selection-based multi-line assignment
  - Tag-based automatic assignment
  - Template-based patterns for document types

##### Storage and Data Management
- **Frontmatter approach**:
  ```yaml
  sonic-graph:
    line-instruments:
      1: "piano"
      5: "violin"
      12-15: "flute"
      "h1": "trumpet"  # All H1 headers
      "code": "synth"  # All code blocks
  ```
- **Sidecar file approach**: `.sonic-assignments.json` files
- **Plugin settings**: Global rules and per-vault customizations
- **Performance optimization**:
  - Incremental parsing of changed lines only
  - Caching with file modification timestamps
  - Lazy loading during playback
  - Background processing during idle time

##### Musical Implementation
- **Timing and rhythm**:
  - Line duration based on content length
  - Phrase grouping for related lines
  - Breathing space between sections
  - Tempo mapping based on document flow
- **Harmonic considerations**:
  - Chord progressions within paragraphs
  - Key relationship maintenance
  - Smooth voice leading between instruments
  - Counterpoint for simultaneous instruments

##### Progressive Implementation
1. **Foundation**: Basic line parsing, manual assignment UI, fallback systems
2. **Automation**: Markdown structure detection, pattern-based rules, bulk tools
3. **Intelligence**: Semantic analysis, context-aware suggestions, learning patterns
4. **Advanced**: Real-time assignment, collaborative sharing, composition tools

### Potential Extensions
- **Collaborative Timelines**: Show multiple users' contributions
- **Semantic Analysis**: Group nodes by topic or content similarity
- **Advanced Layouts**: Tree, radial, or hierarchical arrangements
- **Real-time Mode**: Live updates as vault changes
- **VR/AR Support**: 3D timeline visualization

### Integration Opportunities
- **Git Integration**: Show commit history in timeline
- **Calendar Sync**: Correlate with external events
