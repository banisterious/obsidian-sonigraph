## Benefits of the New Structure

✅ **Better Navigation** - Find specific information faster with focused documents  
✅ **Improved Maintainability** - Each document covers a single system  
✅ **Enhanced Collaboration** - Team members can work on specific areas independently  
✅ **Reduced Cognitive Load** - Smaller, digestible documents instead of one large file
